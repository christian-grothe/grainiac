# Grainiac
Grainiac is a granular sampler that has a terminal user interface. The plugin project does not work at the moment because I am focussing on the standalone. For the standalone version I created a custom midi controller. 
At some point I am planning on releasing this as a DIY package where the sampler can run on a raspberry pi running the terminal user interface on a small lcd screen.

## Todo
- [X] Fixing LoopLength
- [X] Autoconnect Mididevice
- [X] Midi Controller PCB
- [X] Grain Direction
- [X] Reliable Port for Audio Interface
- [ ] Making the enclosure for the controller and raspberry pi
